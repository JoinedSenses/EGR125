As Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin, wrote in The Bridge (the quarterly publication of the NAE), 
"The bottom line is that the things engineers do have consequences, both positive and negative, sometimes unintended, 
often widespread, and occasionally irreversible." 

The more I thought about that, the more I realized that there are deep moral and ethical responsibilities 
associated with the impact of engineering on individuals and on society.
