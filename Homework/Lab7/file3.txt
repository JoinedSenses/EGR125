As I looked back on the achievements of the twentieth century, I was struck by two things. 

First as I have already indicated, I was in awe of how much engineering and engineers matter...
how much they affect our daily lives. 

Second, I realized that the immense societal impact of engineering achievements was almost never predicted by their inventors.
